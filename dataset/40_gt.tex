under treatment randomization as in successfully conducted experiments. This allows identifying the ATE: $\Delta_1 = E[Y_1|D=1] -E[Y_1|D=0]$.
Furthermore, we assume the mediator to be weakly monotonic in the treatment.\vspace{5 pt}\\
\textbf{Assumption 8:} Weak monotonicity of the mediator in the treatment.\\
$\Pr(M(1) \geq M(0)) =1.$\vspace{5 pt}\\
Assumption 8 is standard in the instrumental variable literature on local average treatment effects when denoting by $D$ the instrument and by $M$ the endogenous regressor, see  and . It rules out the existence of defiers.
As discussed in the Appendix , the total ATE $\Delta_1= E[Y_1 |D=1]- E[Y_1 |D=0]$ and QTE $\Delta_1(q) = F_{Y_{1} |D=1}^{-1}(q)- F_{Y_{1} |D=0}^{-1}(q)$ for the entire population are identified under Assumption 7. Furthermore, Assumptions 7 and 8 yield the strata proportions, denoted by $p_{\tau}= \Pr(\tau)$, as functions of the conditional mediator probabilities given the treatment, which we denote by $p_{(m|d)}=\Pr(M=m|D=d)$ for $d, m \in \{0,1\}$ (see Appendix ):
\begin{equation} 
p_a =p_{1|0}, p_c = p_{1|1}-p_{1|0} = p_{0|0}-p_{0|1}, p_n = p_{0|1}.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, Assumptions 2, 7, and 8 imply that (see Appendix )
\begin{equation} 
\Delta_{0,c} =E[Y_0(1,1) - Y_0(0,0)|c] = \frac{E[Y_0|D=1] -E[Y_0|D=0] }{p_{1|1} - p_{1|0}} =  0.
\end{equation}
Therefore, a rejection of the testable implication $E[Y_0|D=1] -E[Y_0|D=0]=0$ in the data would point to a violation of these assumptions.
Assumptions 7 and 8 permit identifying additional parameters, namely the total, direct, and indirect effects on compliers, and the direct effects on never- and always-takers, as shown in Theorems 3 to 5. This follows from the fact that defiers are ruled out and that the proportions and potential outcome distributions of the various principal strata are not selective w.r.t.\ the treatment.\\
